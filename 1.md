### 🧠 Each Step Explained:

1. **You (User Device)**: You type `www.google.com` in your browser.
2. **Router**: Sends the request to your internet provider.
3. **ISP**: Forwards the request to find the website.
4. **DNS**: Converts `www.google.com` to a number like `142.250.182.36`.
5. **Internet Backbone**: The data travels across big global networks.
6. **Web Server**: The website’s actual computer, gives the required page.
7. **Back to You**: The website is shown in your browser in seconds.

Here’s a **clear and simple explanation** of the difference between a **Web Server** and an **Application Server** — especially useful for **10th class to beginner level** understanding:

---

### 📦 1. What is a **Web Server**?

A **web server** is like a **delivery person**. It only handles **simple tasks** — mostly **sending web pages (HTML, CSS, images)** to your browser.

#### 📌 Example:

* When you open **[www.google.com](http://www.google.com)**, the web server sends you the **homepage**.
* It **does not process complex business logic** (like calculating or storing things in a database).

---

### ⚙️ 2. What is an **Application Server**?

An **application server** is like a **smart worker** behind the scenes. It runs **programs/code** (like Java, Python, etc.) to handle **complex logic**, such as:

* Logging in a user
* Talking to databases
* Calculating results

---

### 🧠 Simple Analogy:

| Think of a Pizza Shop:                         |
| ---------------------------------------------- |
| 🍕 Web Server = Waiter – brings you menu/pizza |
| ⚙️ App Server = Chef – cooks your pizza        |

---

### 🔍 Key Differences:

| Feature            | Web Server                    | Application Server              |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Handles            | Static content (HTML, images) | Dynamic content (code, logic)   |
| Examples           | Apache, Nginx                 | Tomcat, JBoss, WebLogic         |
| Language Support   | Mainly HTML, CSS, JS          | Java, Python, PHP, etc.         |
| Talks to Database? | ❌ No                          | ✅ Yes                           |
| Use Case           | Shows website pages           | Processes login, business rules |

---

### 👨‍💻 In Real Projects:

Usually, **both** are used **together**:

* **Web Server** receives the request from the browser.
* Then passes it to the **Application Server** if logic is needed.
* Application Server does the logic, sends result back.
* Web Server shows the final result to the user.

### ✅ Summary:

| Web Server              | Application Server                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| "Shows the website"     | "Runs the logic behind the website" |
| Delivers static content | Generates dynamic content           |
| Lightweight and fast    | Powerful but heavier                |

---
### 🧑‍💻 What are **Standalone Applications**? (Explained Simply)

A **standalone application** is a **software program** that can **run on its own**, **without needing a network or Internet connection**.

---

### ✅ **Key Features of Standalone Applications:**

| Feature                   | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📦 **Runs Locally**       | Installed and used directly on your device (PC, laptop, mobile) |
| 🌐 **No Internet Needed** | Works even when there’s no Wi-Fi or internet                    |
| 💾 **Uses Local Storage** | Saves data on your computer, not on a cloud/server              |
| 🧱 **Self-contained**     | Doesn’t depend on other systems to function                     |

---

### 💡 **Examples of Standalone Applications:**

| Application Name          | What It Does                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **MS Paint**              | Drawing tool on Windows                     |
| **Calculator**            | Math operations without Internet            |
| **Notepad / Text Editor** | Write and save notes locally                |
| **VLC Media Player**      | Plays videos and music on your system       |
| **MS Word (offline)**     | Used for writing documents without internet |

---

### 🔄 **Standalone App vs Web App vs Mobile App**

| Type           | Runs On    | Needs Internet?         | Installed? |
| -------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Standalone App | PC/Laptop  | ❌ No                    | ✅ Yes      |
| Web App        | Browser    | ✅ Yes                   | ❌ No       |
| Mobile App     | Smartphone | ❌/✅ (Some work offline) | ✅ Yes      |

---

### 🎓 Summary for Class 10:

> A **standalone application** is a program that **you install and run directly on your computer or device**, without needing the internet. It works by itself.

---

### 🌐 What is a **Web Application**? (For Class 10 Students)

A **web application** is a **software program** that runs on a **web browser** and requires the **Internet** to work.

You don’t need to **install** anything — just open a browser like Chrome and go to a website.

---

### ✅ **Key Features of Web Applications:**

| Feature             | Description                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
